### About Myself:
My working experience is very diverse. I worked as McDonalds guy when I went to the US as a part of Work and Travel program. After that I have been working as a Support Operator for 2 different companies for almost a year. Then I tried working as a state servant for 2 years. Currently I am working as a Subject Matter Expert in an ITFM company. I decided to try myself in Frontend Development. That is why I started e-attending these courses. Hopefully they will help me master this skill.
